# s5_messenger

A **Flutter package** for secure messaging using [s5](https://s5.pro/) and [MLS](https://www.ietf.org/blog/mls-secure-and-usable-end-to-end-encryption/) (Messaging Layer Security) protocols. Enables easy-to-set-up, end-to-end encrypted messaging between clients.

## Features

- **End-to-end encryption** via MLS
- **Decentralized routing** using S5 for message transportation
- **Cross-platform** support (Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Rust-powered** core via ```flutter_rust_bridge``` for performance
- **Minimal-config** messaging between authenticated clients
